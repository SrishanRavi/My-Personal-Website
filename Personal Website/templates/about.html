    My name is Srishan, and I am an AS level student with a passion for aerospace engineering. I am eager to contribute to the betterment of humanity in the field of STEM, with the goal of improving lives.

    My interests lie in science, technology, history, and politics. I have participated in STEM competitions and Model United Nations (MUN) events. I possess strong leadership skills and have successfully organized two events during my grade 10 year.

    I am also a grade 3 pianist and enjoy listening to and playing my favourite music.
